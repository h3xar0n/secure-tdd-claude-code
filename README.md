# Secure TDD for Claude Code

> **Secure Test-Driven Development (Secure TDD) workflow instructions, skills, and pre-tool hooks for Claude Code CLI agents.**

> [!CAUTION]
> **Use at Your Own Risk**: This repository is a demonstration of an approach and is not an officially supported product or framework. AI coding agents generate and execute code that may be unstable or perform unexpected actions. Run agentic workflows only in isolated development environments and never on systems with access to production credentials, sensitive customer data, or internal networks.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Responsible Use & Manual Verification**: AI models are non-deterministic and can generate incorrect patches or hallucinate findings. All automated code changes and findings must be manually reviewed and verified by a developer or security practitioner before deployment. Do not mass-file unverified, AI-generated reports to open-source maintainers. You are expected to inspect, adapt, and take full responsibility for using this code.

This repository is the dedicated Claude Code distribution of the **[Secure TDD Agent Framework](https://github.com/h3xar0n/secure-tdd-agent-framework)**.

## What's Included

- `CLAUDE.md`: System prompt instructions loaded on Claude Code session start to enforce the 4-phase inner loop (`PLAN` -> `RED` -> `GREEN` -> `REFACTOR`).
- `.claude/skills/`: Specialized kebab-case agent skills for threat modeling, security test writing, defensive coding, and refactor scanning.
- `.claude/settings.json` & `.claude/hooks/security_gate_hook.sh`: PreToolUse bash hook enforcing test-first verification before `git push` runs.
- `CONTEXT.md`: Living repository context, trust boundaries, and approved helpers.

## Getting Started

1. Open this repository in your terminal and launch Claude Code:
   ```bash
   claude
   ```
2. Claude Code automatically ingests `CLAUDE.md` and discovers skills in `.claude/skills/`.
3. Test the local pre-tool hook:
   ```bash
   bash .claude/hooks/tests/run_tests.sh
   ```

## Optional Scanner Engines & Installation

The pre-push security gate hook supports modular scanning engines. Both scanners are **optional**:
- The hook checks which tools are available on your system `PATH`.
- If `semgrep` is not installed, the pipeline skips Stage 1 and proceeds directly to Stage 2 (`cm`).
- If neither scanner is installed, the hook logs an informational notice and allows the push to proceed normally.
- The hook engine is designed to be extended with additional scanners (such as Wiz Code for Stage 1) down the road.

### 1. Semgrep (Stage 1: Open-Source Deterministic AST Scanner)
```bash
# Via Homebrew:
brew install semgrep

# Or via pip:
pip install semgrep
```

### 2. CodeMender CLI (`cm` - Stage 2: Semantic Analysis & Remediation)
```bash
# Authenticate with Google Cloud:
gcloud auth application-default login

# Download and install binary (macOS ARM64 example):
gcloud artifacts generic download     --project=cmoc-prod     --location=us     --repository=codemender-cli-production     --package=cm     --version=stable     --name=cm-darwin-arm64.zip     --destination=./

unzip cm-*.zip && chmod +x cm && sudo mv cm /usr/local/bin/cm
cm init && cm init --verify
```
